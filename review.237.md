Interest of content: Perfect
Very interesting and detailed; well-chosen topics which fit together into a theme

Consistency and quality of visual presentation: Weak
The 'African Elephants' and 'Data Collection' pages are mostly consistent but the other two pages are wildly different. The navbar looks very different on each page. All pages except the index look fine on their own, but inconsistent when viewed together.

Quality of written presentation: Exemplary
Information is well-organised and concisely presented.

Validity of HTML: Very Good
Does it work good? No. It works well...

Evidence of collaboration: Excellent
All members of the team have pushed and pulled from the main repository multiple times. Large amount of work done before the deadline, but also a moderate amount done near the deadline.
