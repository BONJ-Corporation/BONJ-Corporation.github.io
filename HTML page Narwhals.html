<button type="button" class="collapsible">Problems faced by the Narhwals</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>Like many species, global warming and its subsequent impacts are having a serious detromental effect to the life of the Narwhal. 
      In the case of the Narwhal, the rising sea levels caused by the melting ice caps as well as the warmer waters has led to a subsequent
      increase in arctic shipping traffic. This disturbance to the natural habitats and behaviors of the narwhals could have catastroptic consequences
      so it is vital as a society and a community of scientests that we endevour to learn about and preserve the narwhal and it's natural enviroment.
      One way in which we can do this is through the monitoring of their foraging behaviour and any potential impacts caused by human activities.
      However this poses its own challenges due to the nature of the narwhals natural habitats. The remote, isolated location of the arctic regions 
      and the depths of up to 1,000 metres at which they hunt make monitoring and tracking any foraging habbits very difficult.</p>

<button type="button" class="collapsible">Does artificial intelligence hold the answers?</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>Artificial intelligence is, as described in the dictionary, is "The theory and development of computer systems able to perform tasks normally 
      requiring human intelligence, such as visual perception, speech recognition, decision-making and translation between languages. Although AI is 
      most commonly used in comerce, logistics and optimising products, but may now be the key to understandig the foraging habbits of narwhals.
      Mathematicians, Computer Scientests and Marine Biologists from the University of Copenhagen and the Greenland Institute of Natural Resources 
      have collaberated to urilise the relationship between algorithms and Artificial intelligence to demonstrate how the two can be used to map the 
      foraging habits of the Narwhals and thus allow biologists to better care for them." </p>
</div>
<button type="button" class="collapsible">Why is this algorithmic develpopment important?</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>Without having the insight into where the Narwhals hunt for food, they are at risk of being disturbed by increased sea traffic due to the receding 
      sea ice. Previous to this algorithm, it was very difficult to gather data on the movement of the Narwhals due to the harsh conditions and depths 
      at which they hunt at. The most common method used was to attach measuring instruments to the bodies of the Narwhals in order to collect acoustic data. 
      Narwhals use echolocation, the use of clicking sounds to communiate, and familiarise themselves with their enviromnent. For the most part the sound 
      of the Narwhals are repeated clicks however when they begin to hunt, the clicks get closer together eventually resulting in a buzzing sounnd detected 
      by the recording devices. Although this method of tracking is effective in other animals, in the case of the Narwhal, it is impossible to collect data 
      in many of the places in which they hunt, and if data can be collected, the recording devices are insensitive and require high amounts of time consuming 
      manual analysis.  </p>
